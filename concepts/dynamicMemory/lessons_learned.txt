1) sizeof is designed to only work for data types and statically declared arrays and structs.
2) In C99 there are VLA's (variable length arrays) whose size is determined at runtime, but the memory
   is still allocated statically (stack based) and hence sizeof works on VLA's.
3) using sizeof on a pointer to a dynamically allocated array will return the size (in bytes) of the 
   pointer
